	Abstract = {Presynaptic Ca(V)2.2 (N-type) calcium channels are subject to modulation by interaction with syntaxin 1 and by a syntaxin 1-sensitive Galpha(O) G-protein pathway. We used biochemical analysis of neuronal tissue lysates and a new quantitative test of colocalization by intensity correlation analysis at the giant calyx-type presynaptic terminal of the chick ciliary ganglion to explore the association of Ca(V)2.2 with syntaxin 1 and Galpha(O). Ca(V)2.2 could be localized by immunocytochemistry (antibody Ab571) in puncta on the release site aspect of the presynaptic terminal and close to synaptic vesicle clouds. Syntaxin 1 coimmunoprecipitated with Ca(V)2.2 from chick brain and chick ciliary ganglia and was widely distributed on the presynaptic terminal membrane. A fraction of the total syntaxin 1 colocalized with the Ca(V)2.2 puncta, whereas the bulk colocalized with MUNC18-1. Galpha(O,) whether in its trimeric or monomeric state, did not coimmunoprecipitate with Ca(V)2.2, MUNC18-1, or syntaxin 1. However, the G-protein exhibited a punctate staining on the calyx membrane with an intensity that varied in synchrony with that for both Ca channels and syntaxin 1 but only weakly with MUNC18-1. Thus, syntaxin 1 appears to be a component of two separate complexes at the presynaptic terminal, a minor one at the transmitter release site with Ca(V)2.2 and Galpha(O), as well as in large clusters remote from the release site with MUNC18-1. These syntaxin 1 protein complexes may play distinct roles in presynaptic biology.},

@article{Adler2008,
	Abstract = {It is widely recognized that the accuracy of colocalization measurements is dependent upon the quality of the source images. We demonstrate that, as the image quality increases, the measured colocalization, using the Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients, approaches the true colocalization asymptotically. This means that in practice it is difficult to obtain images of sufficient quality for accurate measurements. We introduce the replicate-based noise corrected correlation (RBNCC) which aligns the measured colocalization with the true colocalization: a noise measurement is made for each fluorophore from a pair of replicate images, the two noise measurements are combined to generate a correction factor which is applied to the measured colocalization between the two fluorophores. In consequence, accurate measurements can be obtained even with noisy images, making RBNCC especially attractive for live imaging. Even with images of apparently good quality we found an average discrepancy of about 20\% between the measured and corrected colocalization. A case is made for using the Spearman rank coefficient instead of the Pearson coefficient to measure colocalization.},

@article{Lachmanovich2003,
	Abstract = {Fluorescence imaging of two independently labelled proteins is commonly used to determine their co-localization in cells. Antibody-mediated crosslinking can mediate the patching of such proteins at the cell surface, and their co-localization can serve to determine complex formation among them. However, manual analysis of such studies is both tedious and subjective. Here we present a digital co-localization analysis that is independent of the fluorescence intensity, is highly consistent and reproducible between observers, and dramatically reduces the analysis time. The approach presented is based on a segmentation procedure that creates binary objects, and then determines whether objects belonging to two different groups (e.g. green- and red-labelled) are co-localized. Two methods are used to determine co-localization. The 'overlap' analysis defines two objects as co-localized if the centre of mass of one falls within the area of the other. The 'nearest-neighbour distance' analysis considers two objects as co-localized if their centres are within a threshold distance determined by the imaging modality. To test the significance of the results, the analysis of the actual images is tested against randomized images generated by a method that creates images with uncorrelated distributions of objects from the two groups. The applicability of the algorithms presented to study protein interactions in live cells is demonstrated by co-patching studies on influenza haemagglutinin mutants that do or do not associate into mutual oligomers at the cell surface via binding to AP-2 adaptor complexes. The approach presented is potentially applicable to studies of co-localization by other methods (e.g. electron microscopy), and the nearest-neighbour distance method can also be adapted to study phenomena of correlated placement.},

@article{HariShroff12182007,
	Abstract = {Accurate determination of the relative positions of proteins within localized regions of the cell is essential for understanding their biological function. Although fluorescent fusion proteins are targeted with molecular precision, the position of these genetically expressed reporters is usually known only to the resolution of conventional optics ({approx}200 nm). Here, we report the use of two-color photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to determine the ultrastructural relationship between different proteins fused to spectrally distinct photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (PA-FPs). The nonperturbative incorporation of these endogenous tags facilitates an imaging resolution in whole, fixed cells of {approx}20-30 nm at acquisition times of 5-30 min. We apply the technique to image different pairs of proteins assembled in adhesion complexes, the central attachment points between the cytoskeleton and the substrate in migrating cells. For several pairs, we find that proteins that seem colocalized when viewed by conventional optics are resolved as distinct interlocking nano-aggregates when imaged via PALM. The simplicity, minimal invasiveness, resolution, and speed of the technique all suggest its potential to directly visualize molecular interactions within cellular structures at the nanometer scale.

@article{Costes2004,
	Abstract = {We introduce a novel statistical approach that quantifies, for the first time, the amount of colocalization of two fluorescent-labeled proteins in an image automatically, removing the bias of visual interpretation. This is done by estimating simultaneously the maximum threshold of intensity for each color below which pixels do not show any statistical correlation. The sensitivity of the method was illustrated on simulated data by statistically confirming the existence of true colocalization in images with as little as 3\% colocalization. This method was then tested on a large three-dimensional set of fixed cells cotransfected with CFP/YFP pairs of proteins that either co-compartmentalized, interacted, or were just randomly localized in the nucleolus. In this test, the algorithm successfully distinguished random color overlap from colocalization due to either co-compartmentalization or interaction, and results were verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The accuracy and consistency of our algorithm was further illustrated by measuring, for the first time in live cells, the dissociation rate (k(d)) of the HIV-1 Rev/CRM1 export complex induced by the cytotoxin leptomycin B. Rev/CRM1 colocalization in nucleoli dropped exponentially after addition of leptomycin B at a rate of 1.25 x 10(-3) s(-1). More generally, this algorithm can be used to answer a variety of biological questions involving protein-protein interactions or co-compartmentalization and can be generalized to colocalization of more than two colors.},
