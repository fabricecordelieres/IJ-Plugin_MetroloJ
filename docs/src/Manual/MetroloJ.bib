	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need for a standardized, impartial calibration, and validation protocol on confocal spectral imaging (CSI) microscope systems. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to have testing tools to provide a reproducible way to evaluate instrument performance. METHODS: We evaluated fluorescent spectral beads (FocalCheck) from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen that consist of four pairs with emissions between 500 and 725 nm and a europium macrocycle quantum dye bead. These bead tools compliment our previously published protocol for testing spectral imaging systems that used an inexpensive multi-ion discharge lamp (MIDL) that contains Hg(+), Ar(+), and inorganic fluorophores that emits distinct, stable spectral features. RESULTS: We acquired the spectra of the FocalCheck beads on a Zeiss 510 Meta, a Leica TCS-SP1, a Leica SP2 AOBS, an Olympus FV 1000, and a Nikon C1Si confocal systems and a PARISS microscopic spectral system and of the europium beads on the Leica TCS-SP1 and PARISS spectral imaging systems. A lack of performance with some equipment between 650 and 750 nm was identified using the far red pair of the FocalCheck beads. The position of the slider in front of PMT 2 that reflects light into PMT 1 and PMT 3 affected the measurement of all bead intensities. Unmixing algorithms were used to separate beads with different fluorochromes and separate two fluorochromes on the same bead. CONCLUSIONS: The FocalCheck multi-spectral beads yielded similar profiles on four CSI systems and a PARISS spectral system. The utilization of the spectral FocalCheck beads is helpful to evaluate proper spectral performance, especially in the far red region. Europium beads provide a very narrow spectrum that can help to identify machines that have spectral problems. The dyes located on individual beads or mixed together in ring-core configuration can be used as test particles to demonstrate spectral unmixing with various algorithms.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the standard deviation (sigma) of the fluorescent intensity of a population of beads or pixels expressed as a proportion or percentage of the mean (mu) intensity (CV = sigma/mu). The field of flow cytometry has used the CV of a population of bead intensities to determine if the flow cytometer is aligned correctly and performing properly. In a similar manner, the analysis of CV has been applied to the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) to determine machine performance and sensitivity. METHODS: Instead of measuring 10,000 beads using a flow cytometer and determining the CV of this distribution of intensities, thousands of pixels are measured from within one homogeneous Spherotech 10-microm bead. Similar to a typical flow cytometry population that consists of 10,000 beads, a CLSM scanned image consists of a distribution of pixel intensities representing a population of approximately 100,000 pixels. In order to perform this test properly, it is important to have a population of homogeneous particles. A biological particle usually has heterogeneous pixel intensities that correspond to the details in the biological image and thus shows more variability as a test particle. RESULTS: The bead CV consisting of a population of pixel intensities is dependent on a number of machine variables that include frame averaging, photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage, PMT noise, and laser power. The relationship among these variables suggests that the machine should be operated with lower PMT values in order to generate superior image quality. If this cannot be achieved, frame averaging will be necessary to reduce the CV and improve image quality. There is more image noise at higher PMT settings, making it is necessary to average more frames to reduce the CV values and improve image quality. The sensitivity of a system is related to system noise, laser light efficiency, and proper system alignment. It is possible to compare different systems for system performance and sensitivity if the laser power is maintained at a constant value. Using this bead CV test, 1 mW of 488 nm laser light measured on the scan head yielded a CV value of 4% with a Leica TCS-SP1 (75-mW argon-krypton laser) and a CV value of 1.3% with a Zeiss 510 (25-mW argon laser). A biological particle shows the same relationship between laser power, averaging, PMT voltage, and CV as do the beads. However, because the biological particle has heterogeneous pixel intensities, there is more particle variability, which does not make as useful as a test particle. CONCLUSIONS: This CV analysis of a 10-microm Spherotech fluorescent bead can help determine the sensitivity in a confocal microscope and the system performance. The relationship among the factors that influence image quality is explained from a statistical endpoint. The data obtained from this test provides a systematic method of reducing noise and increasing image clarity. Many components of a CLSM, including laser power, laser stability, PMT functionality, and alignment, influence the CV and determine if the equipment is performing properly. Preliminary results have shown that the bead CV can be used to compare different confocal microscopy systems with regard to performance and sensitivity. The test appears to be analogous to CV tests made on the flow cytometer to assess instrument performance and sensitivity. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) has been used by scientists to visualize three-dimensional (3D) biological samples. Although this system involves lasers, electronics, optics, and microscopes, there are few published tests that can be used to assess the performance of this equipment. Usually the CLSM is assessed by subjectively evaluating a biological/histological test slide for image quality. Although there is a use for the test slide, there are many other components in the CLSM that need to be assessed. It would be useful if tests existed that produced reference values for machine performance. The aim of this research was to develop quality assurance tests to ensure that the CLSM was stable while delivering reproducible intensity measurements with excellent image quality. METHODS: Our ultimate research objective was to quantify fluorescence using a CLSM. To achieve this goal, it is essential that the CLSM be stable while delivering known parameters of performance. Using Leica TCS-SP1 and TCS-4D systems, a number of tests have been devised to evaluate equipment performance. Tests measuring dichroic reflectivity, field illumination, lens performance, laser power output, spectral registration, axial resolution, laser stability, photomultiplier tube (PMT) reliability, and system noise were either incorporated from the literature or derived in our laboratory to measure performance. These tests are also applicable to other manufacturer's systems with minor modifications. RESULTS: A preliminary report from our laboratory has addressed a number of the QA issues necessary to achieve CLSM performance. This report extends our initial work on the evaluation of CLSM system performance. Tests that were described previously have been modified and new tests involved in laser stability and sensitivity are described. The QA tests on the CLSM measured laser power, PMT function, dichroic reflection, spectral registration, axial registration, system noise and sensitivity, lens performance, and laser stability. Laser power stability varied between 3% and 30% due to various factors, which may include incompatibility of the fiber-optic polarization with laser polarization, thermal instability of the acoustical optical transmission filter (AOTF), and laser noise. The sensitivity of the system was measured using a 10-microm Spherotech bead and the PMTs were assessed with the CV concept (image noise). The maximum sensitivity obtainable on our TCS-SP1 system measured on the 10-microm Spherotech beads was approximately 4% for 488 nm, 2.5% for 568 nm, 20% for 647 nm, and 19% for 365 nm laser light. The values serve as a comparison to test machine sensitivity from the same or different manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: QA tests are described on the CLSM to assess performance and ensure that reproducing data are obtained. It is suggested strongly that these tests be used in place of a biological/histological sample to evaluate system performance. The tests are more specific and can recognize instrument functionality and problems better than a biological/histological sample. Utilization of this testing approach will eliminate the subjective assessment of the CLSM and may allow the data from different machines to be compared. These tests are essential if one is interested in making intensity measurements on experimental samples as well as obtaining the best signal detection and image resolution from a CLSM.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Confocal spectral imaging (CSI) microscopic systems currently on the market delineate multiple fluorescent proteins, labels, or dyes within biological specimens by performing spectral characterizations. However, some CSI systems have been found to present inconsistent spectral profiles of reference spectra within a particular system and between related and unrelated instruments. This variability confirms that there is a need for a standardized, objective calibration and validation protocol. METHODS: Our protocol uses an inexpensive multi-ion discharge lamp (MIDL) that contains Hg(+), Ar(+), and inorganic fluorophores that emit distinct, stable, spectral features in place of a sample. We derived reference spectra from the MIDL data to accurately predict the spectral resolution, ratio of wavelength to wavelength, contrast, and aliasing parameters of any CSI system. We were also able to predict and confirm the influence of pinhole diameter on spectral profiles. RESULTS: Using this simulation, we determined that there was good agreement between observed and theoretical expectations, thus enabling us to identify malfunctioning subsystems. We examined eight CSI systems and one nonconfocal spectral system, all of which displayed spectral inconsistencies. No instrument met its optimal performance expectations. In two systems, we established the need for factory realignment that had not been otherwise recognized. CONCLUSIONS: We found that using a primary light source that emits an absolute standard "reference spectrum" enabled us to diagnose instrumental errors and measure accuracy and reproducibility under normalized conditions. With this information, a CSI operator can determine whether a CSI system is working optimally and make objective comparisons with the performance of other CSI systems. We determined that, if CSI systems were standardized to produce the same spectral profile of a MIDL lamp, researchers could be confident that the same experimental findings would be obtained on any CSI system.},
