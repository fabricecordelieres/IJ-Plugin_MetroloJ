abstract = {Thin, uniformly fluorescing reference layers can be used to characterize the imaging conditions in confocal, or more general, sectioning microscopy. Through-focus datasets of such layers obtained by standard microscope routines provide the basis for the approach. A set of parameters derived from these datasets is developed for defining a number of relevant sectioned imaging properties. The main characteristics of a particular imaging situation can then be summarized in a Sectioned Imaging Property-chart or SIPchart. We propose the use of such charts for the characterization of imaging properties in confocal and multiphoton microscopy. As such, they can be the basis for comparison of sectioned imaging condition characteristics, quality control, maintenance or reproduction of sectioned imaging conditions and other applications. Such charts could prove useful in documenting the more relevant properties of the instrumentation used in microscopy studies. The method carries the potential to provide the basis for a general characterization of sectioned imaging conditions as the layers employed can be characterized and fabricated to standard specifications. A limited number of such thin, uniformly fluorescing layers is available from our group for this purpose. Extension of the method to multiphoton microscopy is discussed.},

abstract = {“Are my two proteins of interest at the same location?” Here is a question regularly asked... but rarely answered with precision. The cell biologist expects a yes-or-no answer. However, the use of imaging approaches implies that considering the current resolution, it can not be excluded that both proteins actually are at the same location. This statement is particularly emphasized when considering the evolutions of light microscopy. As an example, one might consider the recent work by Shroff et al. (see figure 4C and D) where PALM (PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy) has been used to overcome the diffraction limit encountered with regular microscopies such as wide field, confocal or TIRF microscopies. Their work proved that by pushing downward the resolution, originally co-localizing proteins appeared to be well apart. Co-localization studies must therefore always be considered relative to the resolution which has to be explicitly stated. While setting the frame of reference is an easy step to go, the means to achieve co-localization studies are to date not so well known. This is mainly due to the widespread of generalist tools lacking information on their application domains and limits. In our previous work we wanted to provide insight in current approaches to study co-localization and introduced two ImageJ plug-ins, JACoP (Just Another Co-localization Plug-in) and 3D object counter, those tools providing the user with means to test and use a wide range of methods. Since this field is highly controversial,3, 4 we have now made an effort to explain alternative methodologies and simplifying JACoP to make it a more user friendly plug-in. In particular, its interface has been rethought and the plug-in is now totally macro recordable. In this communication we introduce the second version of JACoP and remind to the reader the field of application of methods, concluding with a decision tree.},

@article{Zucker2001a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) has been used by scientists to visualize three-dimensional (3D) biological samples. Although this system involves lasers, electronics, optics, and microscopes, there are few published tests that can be used to assess the performance of this equipment. Usually the CLSM is assessed by subjectively evaluating a biological/histological test slide for image quality. Although there is a use for the test slide, there are many other components in the CLSM that need to be assessed. It would be useful if tests existed that produced reference values for machine performance. The aim of this research was to develop quality assurance tests to ensure that the CLSM was stable while delivering reproducible intensity measurements with excellent image quality. METHODS: Our ultimate research objective was to quantify fluorescence using a CLSM. To achieve this goal, it is essential that the CLSM be stable while delivering known parameters of performance. Using Leica TCS-SP1 and TCS-4D systems, a number of tests have been devised to evaluate equipment performance. Tests measuring dichroic reflectivity, field illumination, lens performance, laser power output, spectral registration, axial resolution, laser stability, photomultiplier tube (PMT) reliability, and system noise were either incorporated from the literature or derived in our laboratory to measure performance. These tests are also applicable to other manufacturer's systems with minor modifications. RESULTS: A preliminary report from our laboratory has addressed a number of the QA issues necessary to achieve CLSM performance. This report extends our initial work on the evaluation of CLSM system performance. Tests that were described previously have been modified and new tests involved in laser stability and sensitivity are described. The QA tests on the CLSM measured laser power, PMT function, dichroic reflection, spectral registration, axial registration, system noise and sensitivity, lens performance, and laser stability. Laser power stability varied between 3\% and 30\% due to various factors, which may include incompatibility of the fiber-optic polarization with laser polarization, thermal instability of the acoustical optical transmission filter (AOTF), and laser noise. The sensitivity of the system was measured using a 10-microm Spherotech bead and the PMTs were assessed with the CV concept (image noise). The maximum sensitivity obtainable on our TCS-SP1 system measured on the 10-microm Spherotech beads was approximately 4\% for 488 nm, 2.5\% for 568 nm, 20\% for 647 nm, and 19\% for 365 nm laser light. The values serve as a comparison to test machine sensitivity from the same or different manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: QA tests are described on the CLSM to assess performance and ensure that reproducing data are obtained. It is suggested strongly that these tests be used in place of a biological/histological sample to evaluate system performance. The tests are more specific and can recognize instrument functionality and problems better than a biological/histological sample. Utilization of this testing approach will eliminate the subjective assessment of the CLSM and may allow the data from different machines to be compared. These tests are essential if one is interested in making intensity measurements on experimental samples as well as obtaining the best signal detection and image resolution from a CLSM.

@article{Zucker2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the standard deviation (sigma) of the fluorescent intensity of a population of beads or pixels expressed as a proportion or percentage of the mean (mu) intensity (CV = sigma/mu). The field of flow cytometry has used the CV of a population of bead intensities to determine if the flow cytometer is aligned correctly and performing properly. In a similar manner, the analysis of CV has been applied to the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) to determine machine performance and sensitivity. METHODS: Instead of measuring 10,000 beads using a flow cytometer and determining the CV of this distribution of intensities, thousands of pixels are measured from within one homogeneous Spherotech 10-microm bead. Similar to a typical flow cytometry population that consists of 10,000 beads, a CLSM scanned image consists of a distribution of pixel intensities representing a population of approximately 100,000 pixels. In order to perform this test properly, it is important to have a population of homogeneous particles. A biological particle usually has heterogeneous pixel intensities that correspond to the details in the biological image and thus shows more variability as a test particle. RESULTS: The bead CV consisting of a population of pixel intensities is dependent on a number of machine variables that include frame averaging, photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage, PMT noise, and laser power. The relationship among these variables suggests that the machine should be operated with lower PMT values in order to generate superior image quality. If this cannot be achieved, frame averaging will be necessary to reduce the CV and improve image quality. There is more image noise at higher PMT settings, making it is necessary to average more frames to reduce the CV values and improve image quality. The sensitivity of a system is related to system noise, laser light efficiency, and proper system alignment. It is possible to compare different systems for system performance and sensitivity if the laser power is maintained at a constant value. Using this bead CV test, 1 mW of 488 nm laser light measured on the scan head yielded a CV value of 4\% with a Leica TCS-SP1 (75-mW argon-krypton laser) and a CV value of 1.3\% with a Zeiss 510 (25-mW argon laser). A biological particle shows the same relationship between laser power, averaging, PMT voltage, and CV as do the beads. However, because the biological particle has heterogeneous pixel intensities, there is more particle variability, which does not make as useful as a test particle. CONCLUSIONS: This CV analysis of a 10-microm Spherotech fluorescent bead can help determine the sensitivity in a confocal microscope and the system performance. The relationship among the factors that influence image quality is explained from a statistical endpoint. The data obtained from this test provides a systematic method of reducing noise and increasing image clarity. Many components of a CLSM, including laser power, laser stability, PMT functionality, and alignment, influence the CV and determine if the equipment is performing properly. Preliminary results have shown that the bead CV can be used to compare different confocal microscopy systems with regard to performance and sensitivity. The test appears to be analogous to CV tests made on the flow cytometer to assess instrument performance and sensitivity. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

It is demonstrated to be effective for the correction of non-uniform imaging characteristics across the image (shading correction) as well as for relating fluorescence intensities between images taken with different microscopes or imaging conditions. The variation of the illumination intensity over the image can be determined on the basis of the uniform bleaching characteristics of the layers. This permits correction for the latter and makes bleach-rate-related imaging practical. The significant potential of these layers for calibration in quantitative fluorescence microscopy is illustrated with a series of applications. As the illumination and imaging properties of a microscope can be evaluated separately, the methods presented are also valuable for general microscope testing and characterization.},
